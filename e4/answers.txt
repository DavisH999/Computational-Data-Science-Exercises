Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density? Briefly explain why or why not.
Daily temperatures are a not good way to predict population density.
Based on the output plot, there is no obvious relation between them.
Also, population density could be influenced by other factors which we have not considered, such as the economy and crime rate.

Several of the (larger) data files were was kept compressed on disk throughout the analysis, so they needed to be decompressed ever time we ran our program: that seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with an uncompressed .json or .csv data?
This is because the compressed data uses less memery. So, they take less time to load to cpu from memory.
