1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task?
kNN classifier is best with highest valid score.
Can you give a theory about why? Do you have any theory about why RGB/LAB/HSV worked better for different models?
They have different ways of representing data and emphasises. For example, distance matters in LAB but column of hue is useful.

2. Have a look at the cities in your validation data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction.
Do you feel like the model is making reasonable mistakes?
Yes, because most of them are closed cities, and it is very likely to make some mistakes.
Can you think of any weather features that we could potentially add to make better predictions?
For example, elevation, season, and temperature.
