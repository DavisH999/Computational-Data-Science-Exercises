1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?
for sqrt:
    Transformed data normality p-values: 0.0369 0.108
    Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 0.556
for log:
    Transformed data normality p-values: 0.000402 0.315
    Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 0.000419
for exp:
    Transformed data normality p-values: nan nan
    Transformed data equal-variance p-value: nan
for counts**2:
    Transformed data normality p-values: 2.78e-29 2.99e-11
    Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 7.39e-08
So, based on those results, best is sqrt because the two p-values are greater than 0.05.

2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test.
That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.
For initial T test, p-value is 1.3e-58 and less than 0.05, and we can reject the null hypothesis.
So, the mean of number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays is not same as the comments on weekends.
For transformed T test, the data does not pass the normality test.
But if I do T test on it, the p-value of T test is 3.456473928419179e-64 and less than 0.05, and we can reject the null hypothesis.
So, the mean of number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays is not same as the comments on weekends.

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)
I think the by-week approach are better because its normality p-values (0.308 0.153) and its equal-variance p-value (0.204) are larger than 0.05 meaning pass the normal test and equal-variance test.
Also, its T-test p-value (1.34e-34) is smaller than 0.05, and we can reject null hypothesis, which means the mean of number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays is not same as the comments on weekends.

4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?
print(df_reddit_count_weekday['comment_count'].mean())
1823.5785440613026
print(df_reddit_count_weekend['comment_count'].mean())
1269.5071770334928
So, based on the output, the mean of comments on weekday is larger than the mean of comments on weekend.
