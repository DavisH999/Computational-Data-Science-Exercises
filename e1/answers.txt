1.  Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas?
        Doing computation ,such as addition and division, cross lines or columns.
    Which did you find easier to work with?
        Pandas for me because axis things become tricky when dealing with 3d arrays such as meaning of axis = 3 or even higher axis numbers.
    Which code do you think is easier to read?
        Pandas since I learned sql before, and part of pandas code is similar to sql, which makes me easier to understand the meaning of code.

2.  What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions?
        The Pandas function is about 26 times faster than the loop function.
        timeit pivot_months_pandas(data)
        3.62 ms ± 472 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
        %timeit pivot_months_loops(data)
        94.3 ms ± 3.94 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    How can you explain the difference?
        Under pandas, functions such as groupby, aggregate, and pivot are optimized. So, functions under pandas process data faster than regular loops.
        Also, loop function read the data line by line within loop, which increase the time complexity.
