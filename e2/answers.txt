1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept?
What is the type, and describe the values.

Name: prediction_y_value, Length: 1669, dtype: float64
The result is a Pandas Series. data type is float64
They are y values on the linear regression.


2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph?
based on a range of x values, the linregress function can produce corresponding slope and intercept values. we can use y = m * x +b to compute y values.
so we can get lots of (x,y) dots and connect those dots to the line.

Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?
One created_at value can be converted into a timestamp value. So, they have one-to-one relation.
